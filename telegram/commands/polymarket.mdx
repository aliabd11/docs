Another easy way to place a bet is with the /polymarket command. 
With this command, you use /polymarket with a link to the market you'd like to bet on afterwards.

ok.bet attempts to parse the market from the provided link and will provide you the associated market (or *markets* in the event of a multi-outcome event)
