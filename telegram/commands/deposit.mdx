Use /deposit to deposit into your ok.bet wallet. You can either directly fund your wallet by sending USDC.e on Polygon to your ETH wallet or utilize our bridging feature by sending USDC on Solana to your Solana wallet.

Note that in the event of a failure with the Solana bridge, you can retrieve your funds at any time by exporting your Solana wallet using /export. Likewise if an asset other than USDC.e is sent to your ETH wallet.
