There is no points program as of yet. That said, we *are* keeping track of historical usage data and do want to reward active users (whether that comes from a fee sharing program in the future or a more explicit points program). Stay tuned.

It's also worth noting that by using ok.bet, you benefit from exposure to a potential Polymarket points season since your ok.bet account is *also* a Polymarket account.
