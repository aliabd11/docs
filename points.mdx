You can earn points through a variety of methods limited to not included to placing bets, inviting friends and trying out various other parts of the bot. The exact details on earning points is intentionally omitted in order to preserve the sanctity of the points program.

The “OK” token is also live with CA “hxyiu433tdncmmgugffgg95awtdwmbmnapaoq9sdw4cb” (Dexscreener). Points are also earned based on the number of “OK” tokens in your wallet.

Points will play a part in both phase two and phase three of okbet.

It's also worth noting that by using ok.bet, you benefit from exposure to a potential Polymarket points season since your ok.bet account is *also* a Polymarket account. As well as Kalshi if you're enrolled since your okbet is an all-in-one account.
