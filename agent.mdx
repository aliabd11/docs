title: "Agent"
---

Introducing "hey ok", just like "hey siri". Internally we call this "agent mode" part of ["The Machine"](machine).

You can now talk to the bot completely in natural language with "hey ok". Want to get recommendations for markets to bet on?

The big difference between this and other conversational bots is that your critical data is completely sandboxed from the "AI". Agent mode doesn't ever see your private keys and *doesn't* hallucinate. This is because this was built after we had already built out a comprehensive backend that could handle all sorts of functionality. As a result, it acts more like a knowledge router guiding users to the right command for their query.

At present, only Polymarket is supported with "hey ok" mode but Kalshi and Limitless support is coming *very soon*.

Examples:

- Quickly bet $50 on a specific bet

- Find markets in a specific category that expire tomorrow

- Get recommendations for markets with alpha and one-click bet

... and much much more!

This is a quickly evolving part of our bot and all work here will also be deeply integrated as part of the web app (and other potential platforms) as well.
