The $OK token can be found on [Dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/hxyiu433tdncmmgugffgg95awtdwmbmnapaoq9sdw4cb) with CA (8biqsLDiRPaPM11S42zKtNaC3WWKF64PNoPG9htzy99n).

# Fee tiers

The $OK token is designed to provide additional benefits to ok bet users through a graduated fee structure. The more $OK tokens a user holds, the lower their trading fees will be AND the more points they'll qualify for.

| Level | $OK Required | Fee tier
| 0 | 0 OK | 0.01%
| 1 | 1,000 OK | 0.0455%
| 2 | 5,000 OK | 0.04%
| 3 | 10,000 OK | 0.035%
| 4 | 25,000 OK | 0.025%
| 5 | 50,000 OK | 0.020%
| 6 | 100,000 OK | 0.015%
| 7 | 500,000 OK | 0.013%
| 8 | 1,000,000 OK | 0% (no fees!)


$OK tokens held in your ok bet's Solana wallet will be used to determine your fee tier. We will automatically apply the appropriate fee discount based on your token balance. Holding $OK tokens in your wallet is sufficient to qualify for the different fee tiers.

This progressive fee structure is designed to reward loyal users (small fish and whales alike). In conjunction with our points program, users will also soon have the ability to earn $OK tokens for free helping them go up a level.

# Buybacks

To help support the $OK token, a portion of fees generated on the platform will be allocated toward a token buyback and burn program.

We will conduct a buyback every time fees accumulated have reached $5,000 USD creating natural buy pressure based on platform usage. This is only the first of a couple mechanisms planned to support the token, stay tuned for more!
