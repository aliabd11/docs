We are an *independent* token designed to grow as the app grows.

# Fee tiers

The token is designed to provide additional benefits to ok bet users through a graduated fee structure. The more $OK tokens a user holds, the lower their trading fees will be AND the more points they'll qualify for.

OK tokens held in your ok bet's Solana wallet will be used to determine your fee tier. We will automatically apply the appropriate fee discount based on your token balance. Holding OK tokens in your wallet is sufficient to qualify for the different fee tiers.

This progressive fee structure is designed to reward loyal users (small fish and whales alike). In conjunction with our points program, users will also soon have the ability to earn $OK tokens for free helping them go up a level.

Additional token utility will be revealed as part of phase three.
