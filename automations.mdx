Automations are a part of phase two of okbet. Live in both the trading terminal and the bot, automations are a seamless way to automatically place bets based on advanced signals.

### Insider detection

This is an advanced feature live in the trading terminal and soon in the bot. With this feature, "the machine" will automatically detect insider buys and insider sells. Once an insider buy or insider sell is detected, you can configure it to automatically buy or sell positions based on parameters that you configure creating a truly agentic bot.

### Multivariate limit orders

No longer are you limited to orders that fill solely on price. Use advanced parameters such as liquidity, volume or a combination of the above to create orders that fill when you want. This is particularly useful in markets that do not yet have sufficient liquidity to support the size you'd like to bet or where indicators such as a combination of price and volume are a tell into a potentially profitable market. With okbet, you can use signals from everywhere to determine when to bet.
