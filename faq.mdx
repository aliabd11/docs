## Where are my keys stored?

We use the [GCP KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management?hl=en) to securely encrypt your private keys. 
This includes new accounts created on ok.bet and accounts imported from Polymarket.

## Where are my bridged Solana funds?

If the bridge from USDC on Solana to USDC.e on Polygon failed, it could be for a number of reasons including the Solana wallet provided not having enough SOL to complete the transaction (we try to front that for our users). 
Note that your funds are never lost though, you can retrieve them at any time by getting your Solana private key using /export.

## What are the fees?

Fees are 100bps (1%) on buys and sells.

## I just see "buy" and "sell". Are these market or limit orders?

At the moment, we only support market buys and sells. 
With Polymarket, technically *all* orders are represented as "limit" orders so market orders are really orders executed at the *best available* price. Note that this may result in less favorable fills on markets that are lower volume.

We plan on supporting explicit limit orders in the future. Stay tuned.
