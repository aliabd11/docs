## What is okbet?

okbet is an all-in-one platform that exists on both web through the pro trading terminal and Telegram via the bot for betting on prediction markets. We are the first of our kind for betting on Polymarket and we also offer seamless support for Kalshi (and soon Limitless). This one-stop shop allows users to avoid having to juggle different accounts for different platforms with a professional betting interface for all. 

We default to Polymarket but we also offer support for Kalshi and Limitless.

## Where are my keys stored?

We use the [GCP KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management?hl=en) to securely encrypt your private keys. 
This includes new accounts created on ok.bet and accounts imported from Polymarket.

## Where are my bridged Solana funds?

If the bridge from USDC on Solana to USDC.e on Polygon failed, it could be for a number of reasons including the Solana wallet provided not having enough SOL to complete the transaction (we try to front that for our users). 
Note that your funds are never lost though, you can retrieve them at any time by getting your Solana private key using /export.

## What are the fees?

Fees are 100bps (1%) on buys and sells.

## Why did my market order fill at this price?

With Polymarket, technically *all* orders are represented as "limit" orders so market orders are really orders executed at the *best available* price. Note that this may result in less favorable fills on markets that are lower volume.

You can create limit orders to have more granular control over where you'd like orders to fill at. Likewise applies with betting on Kalshi and Limitless.

## What is phase two? Phase three?

- Phase 2 (rolled out throughout Q4)
  - The pro trading terminal going live to everyone.
  - The Machine with its full functionality revealed to all users.
  - Full support for every single notable prediction market in a single app.
  - ... and more

- Phase 3 [hidden]
  - This is the final and most exciting phase of okbet. This will be unveiled after a successful execution of phase 2 and will include a heavy emphasis on the "OK" token as well as 'owning' the marketplace. More to be revealed...
